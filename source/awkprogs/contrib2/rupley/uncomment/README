Three solutions to the problem of uncommenting C code - one written in C
(by Chris Torek), another a Lex source (by myself), and the third a sed
script (by Maarten Litmaath).

It is instructive to compare the examples. 

The C code is fast and straightforward but difficult to get right (Chris
Torek wrote it in 10 minutes, correctly, but several other posters did
not do so well).

Maarten Litmaath's sed script is a tour de force, and worth study for
its techniques that might be used elsewhere.  The posting
(post.litmaath) comments on the method.  But it is not the simplest or
the fastest way to uncomment.

Lex is preferred, IMHO - simple, easy to write and get right, and in
time of execution close to the C-code solution. Lex is character-stream
oriented, as distinguished from the line orientation of sed and awk,
so it serves well for matching patterns that cross line boundaries.

For a trial of all three:
