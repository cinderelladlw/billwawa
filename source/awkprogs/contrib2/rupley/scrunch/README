Problem: scrunch cpp output to make it more readable.

Compress runs of "#" lines and blank lines, or runs of two or more
blank lines:

	(\n*# lineno "file"\n+)+  or  \n\n\n+

into a single line:

	# lineno "file"\n

which is output before the next line of program text (corresponding to
line "lineno" of the source "file").  The values of "lineno" and "file"
are adjusted for changes in source resulting from #include statements.

Two solutions: an awk version (by Stephen Peckham) and a Lex version
(by myself).

Both solutions are comparably simple.  Here the character-stream processing
of Lex has no advantage over the line-oriented processing of awk. Thus,
IMHO, awk is preferable.  C-code or sed-script solutions would be more
complicated.
