The directories "misc" and "roff" have several scripts that I expect
are commonly found but I wish I had been given me when I started using
UNIX. They are useful, at least to me. I expect you already have them
or something like them in your manuscript.

The directories "uncomment" and "scrunch" perhaps deserve some comment.
Each addresses a problem - respectively, the removal of comments from 
C code and making readable the output of the UNIX preprocessor.
Both give an awk or sed solution to the problem, and also one or more 
other solutions. 

In a text presumably centered on awk and sed, is it proper to compare
the virtues of different approaches: C vs Lex vs awk vs sed?  Clearly,
I hope you will do this. And thus the stuff in "uncomment" and "scrunch".

Most sed and awk scripts are pretty targeted and personal.  If you
find the attached stuff of interest, I would be happy to send along
another batch.

Hope this helps.
