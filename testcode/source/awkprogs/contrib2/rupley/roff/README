It is convenient to have a script that does a good bit of the option
setting for nroff (or troff).  The settings are likely to be very system
and user-specific.  Thus the attached is at best a framework or loose
and kludgy model.

Why awk?  Convenient pattern matching and string handling, which would
be possible but more difficult in a pure shell script or in C code.
Also, easy to modify, once the framework is there.
